{{!-- same question as sign up: action="/users/"
cuz then the route is /users/ and home load but won't work right, user won't sign in after signing up this way. --}}
<form action="/users/" method="POST">
    <input type="email" name="email" required>
    <input type="password" name="password" required>
    <button type="submit">Sign Up</button>
</form>
